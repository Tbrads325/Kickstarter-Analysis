# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and advise Louise on her fund raising plans
---
Louise should think of starting her fund raising idea around the months of May and June as these months have had successful campaigns in the past. Moreover, plays that have fund raised in the past have typically been successful. However, Louise may want to rethink the 10000 dollar goal as it exceeds both the mean, median and Upper Quartile of successful theatre/play campaigns within the Kickstarter data.
